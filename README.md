Point and click adventure game about Quidditch the Dog.
Quidditch the Dog wants cuddles all day. Unfortunately, being a large boxer dog,
he has grown too large to be a lap dog.

Fortunately, Quidditch is as smart and determined as he is cute. He is devising
a plan to sneak into a petting zoo where he can get cuddles all day!
